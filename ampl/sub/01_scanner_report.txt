                     RW244: SCANNER SUBMISSION REPORT 2020
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Briefly list any known bugs and limitations in your scanner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	[None.]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Describe whatever help you have received from other people.  Write down their
   names (including the lecturer, demis, classmates, and friends).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [I spoke to Jean Durand quite a bit discussing how to approach the project.]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Describe any serious problems you have encountered.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [I struggled quite a bit with the process_string because even when i did not
   allocate enough memory I would not get a seg fault which is very strange. I
   don't understand why when I allocate only 1 space in memory with malloc why
   it does not throw an error if i fill this memory up with a strig much larger
   than one.]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Feel free to provide any additional comments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [The project is cool and i had fun working on the scanner. Thank you for the
   cool project!]
